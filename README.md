# polymer-2.0-example
Example of working with Polymer 2.0.

I recommend installing the Polymer CLI to help bootstrap new projects:

And here's a Polymer 2.0-preview template to spin up new 2.x projects from the Polymer CLI:

Polymer 1.7.x is the current stable release (as of 2016-12-19):
https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/release-notes#v-1-7-0

Polymer 2.0-preview, as the name implies, is the current pre-release of the next major version:
https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/2.0-preview

Polymer 2.x offers a couple of compelling reasons to upgrade -- specifically, the upgrade to ES6 syntax on the surface and Web Components v1 under the covers:

This is a nice Polymer 2.0 tutorial, although it's more of the "let's get something quickly pushed to production by downloading a bunch of pre-written code" variety than the "let's learn Polymer 2.x from scratch" variety: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/polymer-2-carousel/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0
